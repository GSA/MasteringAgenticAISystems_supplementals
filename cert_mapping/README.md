# Certification Mapping for "Mastering Agentic AI Systems"

## Overview

**"Mastering Agentic AI Systems"** is a comprehensive study material covering agentic AI systems, from fundamentals through advanced production deployment. While originally designed to provide comprehensive support for the **NVIDIA NCP-AAI (NVIDIA Certified Profesional- Agentic AI)** certification, the breadth and depth of this material make it a valuable resource for preparation across multiple other AI certifications:

- **AWS AIP-C01** (AWS Certified: AI Practitioner)
- **Databricks Generative AI Engineer Associate**
- **Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE)**
- **Microsoft AI-102** (Azure AI Engineer Associate)

This folder contains detailed mappings showing how study chapters align with knowledge items for each certification.

## Understanding the Mappings

The detailed mapping results are available in the CSV files within this folder. Each file lists all chapters and shows exactly which knowledge items receive "H", "M", "L", or "N" ratings:

- **`nvidia_NCP-AAI.csv`** – Full mapping of 94 chapters to 53 NVIDIA knowledge items
- **`aws_AIP-C01.csv`** – Full mapping of 94 chapters to AWS Certified AI Practitioner knowledge areas
- **`databricks_genAI_EngAsc.csv`** – Full mapping of 93 chapters to 54 Databricks skills
- **`google_PMLE.csv`** – Full mapping of 93 chapters to 36 Google Cloud ML Engineer knowledge items
- **`microsoft_AI-102.csv`** – Full mapping of 93 chapters to Azure AI-102 certification knowledge

Each certification mapping file (`.csv`) indicates how chapter content aligns with specific certification knowledge items using a four-level relevance scale:

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **H** (Highly Relevant) | Mastering this chapter content directly prepares you for questions requiring this knowledge item. The chapter provides comprehensive coverage of the concept. |
| **M** (Moderate) | The chapter provides supplementary content. Combined with other chapters, it contributes meaningfully to mastery of this knowledge item. |
| **L** (Low) | The chapter contains tangential or minimal relevant content for this knowledge item. |
| **N** (Not Relevant) | The chapter does not address this knowledge item. |

Open these files to see the complete alignment for each chapter-knowledge item pair.

## Chapter Coverage by Certification

The table below provides a quick reference showing which chapters contain **highly relevant content (H)** for each certification. A 🟢 indicates the presence of one or more "H" ratings for that certification's knowledge items.
