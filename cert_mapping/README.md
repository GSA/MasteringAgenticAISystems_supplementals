# Certification Mapping for "Mastering Agentic AI Systems"

## Overview

This folder contains detailed mappings between chapters in the **"Mastering Agentic AI Systems"** study material and knowledge items across five major AI/ML certifications:

- **NVIDIA NCP-AAI** (NVIDIA Certified Associate AI)
- **AWS AIP-C01** (AWS Certified: AI Practitioner)
- **Databricks Generative AI Engineer Associate**
- **Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE)**
- **Microsoft AI-102** (Azure AI Engineer Associate)

## Design Philosophy

The chapters in this study material were **originally designed to comprehensively support the NVIDIA NCP-AAI certification**. However, the breadth and depth of content have been structured to provide valuable preparation for pursuing other major cloud and AI certifications as well.

## Understanding the Mappings

### Knowledge Item Relevance Levels

Each mapping file (`.csv`) indicates how chapter content aligns with specific certification knowledge items:

| Level | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **H** | Highly Relevant | Mastering this chapter content directly prepares you for questions requiring this knowledge item. The chapter provides comprehensive coverage. |
| **M** | Moderate | The chapter provides supplementary content. Combined with other chapters, it contributes to mastery of the knowledge item. |
| **L** | Low | The chapter contains tangential or minimal relevant content for this knowledge item. |
| **N** | Not Relevant | The chapter does not address this knowledge item. |

## Chapter Coverage Summary

The following table shows which chapters contain **highly relevant content (H)** for each certification. A 🟢 indicates that the chapter has one or more "H" ratings for that certification's knowledge items.
